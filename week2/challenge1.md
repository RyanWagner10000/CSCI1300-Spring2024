#### **CSCI 1300 CS1: Starting Computing**
#### **Naidu/Godley - Spring 2024**
#### **Challenge 1 - Week of January 22, 2024**

These exercises for this week will give you practice working with variables and operators. The first three questions can be done with only this information, however the "Added Challenge" for each problem will require learning and using conditional statements. 

# Exercises

1. Write a program that calculates change. Your program should accept a total number of cents, and output the number of whole dollars, quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies that would be used to make change for that amount.

     *Added Challenge*: Add input validation. Make sure the user can only enter usable values. Consider the values "potato", "-34", and "1.56" for the possible total cents. What should happen if the user enters these values?

2. Write a program that calculates the volume of a fish tank. Ask the user for *three* values: the length, the width, and the height of the tank in inches. Use these values to calculate the total volume of the tank in cubic inches. Then, translate cubic inches into gallons and tell the user how many gallons can fit in the fish tank. Hint: there are 231 cubic inches to a gallon.

     *Added Challenge*: Add input validation. What values could a user type in that are acceptable, and what are not? Consider things like "tree", "1.5", "-1", and other things someone might enter to break your program.

3. Write a program to calculate how expensive gas for a road trip will be. You will need to ask the user two things: how many miles they are driving, and how many miles per gallon their car averages for efficiency. With these two pieces of information and assuming gas is $3/gallon, print the total cost of gas for this road trip.

     *Added Challenge*: Add input validation for both user inputs. Does the expected input vary for these two values? What type of values might someone submit to break your program?
