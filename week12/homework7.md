**Warning:** you are not allowed to use global variables, string streams, vectors, pointers, and references for this homework.

If you are suspected of using an outside source to complete homework, you may be called for an in-person interview and could risk losing points for the assignment.

For questions that require the use of classes or functions, coderunner will check if you have written the classes and functions correctly. DO NOT WRITE ALL YOUR CODE IN ```main()```! Your code will NOT compile if you do not have the correct function. See below for an example of what this could look like: <br>

## Question 1 (10 points): Galaxy Class <a name="question1"></a>

Create a class `Galaxy` by splitting the code into the following files:
- A header file ```Galaxy.h``` to declare the definition of the class
- An implementation file ```Galaxy.cpp``` to implement the class defined in the header
- A driver file ```GalaxyDriver.cpp``` that contains the `main` function

The Galaxy class comprises of the following attributes:

**Data members (private)**

| **Member Type** | **Member Name** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| ```string```    | _name      | Name of the Galaxy      |
| ```const static int```       | _MAX_SIZE       | Maximum size of the ```_radii``` array; will be ```10``` for this question     |
| ```int[]```       | _radii       | Array containing the radius of Planets in the Galaxy. The size of this array is ```_MAX_SIZE```     |
| ```int```       | _current_size       | Number of planets in the ```_radii``` array     |

**Member Functions (public)**

| **Function** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
|Default constructor|Creates a new instance of ```Galaxy``` by setting ```_name``` to an empty string, ```_current_size``` to ```0``` and each radius in the ```_radii``` array to ```0```|
|```Galaxy(string)```|Creates a new instance of ```Galaxy``` with ```_name``` as the string parameter. The ```_current_size``` is set to ```0``` and each radius in the ```_radii``` array is ```0```|
|```Galaxy(string, int[], int)```|Creates a new instance of ```Galaxy``` with ```_name``` as the string parameter, ```_current_size``` as the int parameter, and fills the ```_radii``` array. <br/>*See Function Specification table below for more details*  |
|```string getName()```| Returns the ```_name``` of the Galaxy |
|```int getCurrentSize()```| Returns the ```_current_size``` of the Galaxy |
|```void setName(string)```| Sets the ```_name``` to the value of the string parameter |

## Question 6 (5 points): Loading Characters <a name="question6"></a>
Our game for the project will begin by loading data from the provided text files. In this question, the sample outputs are from loading data from [players.txt](input_files/players.txt) and [enemies.txt](input_files/enemies.txt). The CodeRunner will use the data from [players_full.txt](input_files/players_full.txt), [enemies_full.txt](input_files/enemies_full.txt), [players_full_invalid.txt](input_files/players_full_invalid.txt), [enemies_full_invalid.txt](input_files/enemies_full_invalid.txt)

Write a function ```loadCharacters()``` that reads data from a text file and fills an array of Entity objects. The text file contains information about different characters, with each character's information separated by the character ```|``` and each character listed on a new line. The function specification is provided below.<br>

*Function Specifications*:

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Function: <br>
```loadCharacters(string, Entity[], const int, bool)```
</td>
<td>

```cpp
bool loadCharacters(string filename, Entity characters[], const int CHARACTERS_SIZE, bool is_enemy)
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Purpose: </td>
<td>

Reads data from the text file ```filename``` and fills the array of Entity objects ```characters[]```. For each character, set the value of ```_is_enemy``` based on the provided `is_enemy` parameter.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Parameters: </td>
<td>

string ```filename```: Name of the text file to be read <br>
Entity ```characters[]```: Array of Entity objects to be filled <br>
const int ```CHARACTERS_SIZE```: The size of ```characters``` array <br>
bool ```is_enemy```: Specifies if the character is an enemy
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Return Value: </td>
<td>

- ```bool``` : Checks if characters were successfully added into the array.
- The function should not print anything.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Error Handling/Boundary Conditions: </td>
<td>

- Return ```false``` if the file cannot be opened.
- Empty lines should not be added to the array.
- Return ```true``` if the characters are successfully read and stored in the array
- The first line of the text file should not be used to create an object as it only contains the headers of the attributes.

int main()
{
    string filename = "players.txt";
    const int PLAYERS_SIZE = 5;
    Entity players[PLAYERS_SIZE];
    bool is_enemy = false;
    cout << "Function returned value: " << loadCharacters(filename, players, PLAYERS_SIZE, is_enemy) << endl << endl;
    // Print the contents of the players array
    for (int i = 0; i < PLAYERS_SIZE; i++)
    {
        if (players[i].getName() != "")
        {
            players[i].printStats();
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
}
```

The expected output after the function call: <br>
```
Function returned value: 1

Odysseus's stats:

## Question 7 (7 points): Build the Menu <a name="question7"></a>
Let's create a game menu using the components from the previous questions. Write a program that loads the players and enemies from a file, allowing users to select and display their stats. <br/>

**Note**: After selecting the characters, make sure to create a Game object and store the characters in the Game object. This will be useful for project 2.

> **Note**: The following are the sample outputs only using [players.txt](input_files/players.txt) and [enemies.txt](input_files/enemies.txt).

```md
Select from the following options:
1. Select Players and Enemies
2. Display Players' stats
3. Display Enemies' stats
4. Edit a Player's Stats
5. Edit an Enemy's Stats
6. Exit
```
For option `1`, the program should validate the user input against the list of characters and continuously prompt the user until a valid input is provided. Furthermore, each character can only be selected once. This means that once a character is chosen, it should be **removed** from the list of available characters. Therefore, the program should display the updated list of available characters each time a new character selection is made.

> Please note that Blue is program output, and white is user input.
### Option 1

For this option, you have to read the characters from [players_full.txt](input_files/players_full.txt), [enemies_full.txt](input_files/enemies_full.txt) for players and enemies, respectively, to pass the test cases on coderunner ([players.txt](input_files/players.txt) and [enemies.txt](input_files/enemies.txt) are used in the screenshots to reduce the amount of text). Also, you have to re-read the characters from the files everytime the user selects this option in the menu. Two players and two enemies have to be selected in this option. Below are the sample runs:

![alt text](images/player_menu_selection.png)

If a character entered is not found in the list, print a corresponding error message and re-prompt the user for input until the user enters a valid input.   

![alt text](images/player_invalid_menu_selection.png)

![alt text](images/enemies_invalid_menu_selection.png)


### Options 2 and 3
Below are the sample runs for displaying the stats for players and enemies:

![alt text](images/players_stats.png)

![alt text](images/enemies_stats.png)

### Options 4 and 5
Below are the sample outputs for editing the stats of players and enemies:

```md
Editing player [player's name] stats:
1. Edit hp
2. Edit condition
3. Edit gold
```

```md
Editing enemy [enemy's name] stats:
1. Edit hp
2. Edit condition
3. Edit gold
```
#### Option 4
Top menu:<br/>
![alt text](images/player_edit_select_menu.png)

Similar to Option 1, the user input should be validated against the chosen characters and continuously prompt the user until a valid input is provided.

Sub menu:<br/>
![alt text](images/player_edit_stat_sub_menu.png)

The value of `hp` should be a non-negative double value. The value of `gold` should be a non-negative integer value. The value of `condition` should be one among `H`, `D` or `P`.



### Option 5

The same set of validation used in Option 4 should be implemented here.

Top menu:<br/>
![alt text](images/enemy_edit_select_menu.png)

Sub menu:<br/>

![alt text](images/enemy_edit_stat_sub_menu.png)


### Option 6
Below is the sample for Option 6

![alt text](images/exit_menu.png)

### Invalid Option
When the user enters input that is not between 1-6, following is the output:

![alt text](images/invalid_menu.png)

<br/>
<br/>

> **Note**: Use the following for all the dashed lines in the menu:

```
